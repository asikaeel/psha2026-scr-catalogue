# Updated SCR Earthquake Catalogue
This repository contains the updated Stable Continental Region (SCR) earthquake catalogue developed as part of the Master’s thesis “Evaluating the Impact of Source‑Zone Configurations and Maximum Magnitude in PSHA for Nuclear Sites in Finland” (Asikainen, 2026).

The dataset extends the global SCR earthquake catalogue originally published by EPRI (2012) by integrating events from the Reviewed ISC Bulletin, performing magnitude harmonisation, and removing duplicate events. All processing steps are documented in detail in the thesis.

The catalogue lists for each earthquake:
- the date of occurrence  
- the epicentral location  
- the expected moment magnitude **E[M]** together with its associated standard deviation **sigmaM** 
- the domain (**DN**) in which the event occurred  
- the data source of the observation  

Events marked **EPRI** originate directly from the EPRI (2012) SCR catalogue, whereas entries labelled **ISC** or **Merged** were added or processed as part of the thesis work.
